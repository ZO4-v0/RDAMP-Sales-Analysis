-----------------START OF ANALYSIS------------------------------------

TOOLS USED : EXCEL & POWERBI 

1. Create a raw copy of dataset to start with exploratory data analysis
2. Review in Excel for missing values , errors or duplicates.
   a. Check Date correct format
       i.  =Istext(B2) : Rows Mixed with Text Format & Date Format
       ii. =TEXT(B2,"MM/DD/YYYY") : Convert text to MM/DD/YYYY
       iii. Convert text to Date Using Date Function
       iv . =Date(year,month,date)
       v. Year :  =RIGHT(D2,4)
       vi. Month : =MID(D2,FIND("/",D2,1)+1,2)
       vii. Date : = =LEFT(D2,FIND("/",D2,1)-1)
   b. Observed Missing Values on Country & Region
       i. Created a unqiue identifier (city-postal) to match store_location and Ace_superstore dataset
       ii. Using VLookup fill country & region :
       iii. =VLOOKUP(F2,'Store locations'!$C:$E,3,FALSE) Anomaly : Region have incorrect data  - Fixed using Vlookup
       iv.  =VLOOKUP(F2,'Store locations'!$C:$D,2,FALSE) Anomaly : Country Missing data - Fixed using Vlookup
       v. Replace Yorkshire & the Humber -> Yorkshire and the Humber
    c. Observed Missing Values on Category
       i. Sort Sub-category A-Z : to group subcategory and filling up missing values in category by comparing the adjacent values
    d. Observed Costprice & SalesPrice with Negative value :
       i. =ABS(N2) =ABS(O2) to reflect correct number and round to 2 decimal places.
    e. Observed discount column with Null values
       i. Replace null values with 0 : No discount given
       ii format to percentage
  
   
4. Load Clean excel file in PowerBI
   
5. Perform further data quality assessment and profil based on entire dateset.
   a. Enable Column quality to check each column for error or missing values.
   b. Enable column profile to check data statistics ( min , max , errors)
   c. Enable Column Distribution to assess duplicate/unique Values.
   d. Correct Formats
     i. Text : Order ID , Order Mode , Customer ID , City, Postal Code , Country, Region , Proeduct ID , Product Name , Category , Sub-Category.
  ii. Date : Order Date
 iii. Fixed Decimal Number : Sales , Cost Price round to 2 decimal places
  iv. Whole Number : Quantity



7.  Summarize total sales, revenue, and discount rates by region and segment 
   i. Tolal Sales = Sum( Ace_Superstore_retail_dataset[Sales] * Ace_Superstore_retail_dataset[Quantity])
   ii.Revenue =
